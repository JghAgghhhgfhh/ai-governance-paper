## 📄 Project Overview
This repository contains the **research paper, architecture diagrams, and prototype code** for a six-module AI closed-loop governance framework.  
The system integrates AI decision-making layers with **embedded responsible entities** to ensure traceability, accountability, and human oversight in national governance.

**Core Contribution**:
- Introduces the **Accountability & Governance Hub** as the 6th module, enabling cross-module coordination and unified accountability.
- Embeds responsibility entities directly into the architecture, linking each AI layer to its legal and operational custodian.
- Provides a **feasibility analysis, implementation roadmap, and visualized system design**.
